## About
What is your faction? Master the new possibilities of physics-based hack & slash! Defeat your friends in the arena and conquer the world in the coop campaign!

**Single-handedly defeat your friends**  
With a single button, you control multiple characters and all their actions. Yet it can be learned within seconds. This makes it the ideal party game to play on a big screen.

**Whose blood is that?**  
Hack, smash and blast through rows of enemies! Missing a leg? It's but a flesh wound!  
Chop until you drop!

**Mastery**  
Time your spins, rolls and attacks right to chop off limbs and be victorious!

**Old school couch gaming**  
Play through the co-op campaign to unlock new characters, arenas and factions; duel it out with 2-4 players in the arena mode or play a knock out tournament with unlimited participants!

**Explore, discover, encounter**  
Travel across mountains and forests, swamps and settlements. Meet the locals - and wipe them out!

Some of them will join you on your conquest against evil.

## Involvement
During my internship at Extra Nice, I got to work on Skirmish as a level designer. Although the focus of the internship was level design and coding, the company was open-minded and supportive, even allowing me to explore and contribute to their social media presence.  
It was a refreshing experience to follow my internship at Extra Nice. I'm glad Extra Nice was my introduction to the larger game industry, and it wouldnâ€™t be the last time I worked together with them!
