## About
SCHiM is a game about jumping from shadow to shadow in a relaxing and lively environment. This 3D platformer takes elements of light, shadow & animation and adds them directly to the gameplay, delivering an experience that you will only find in SCHiM.

**What is a schim?**  
A schim is the soul and spirit of an object, thing, or living being. Everything in the world has one. A schim should never be separated from their thing! This does happen to your schim, this schim who is attached to a human being is separated from them early on in the game.

Can you get back to them before it's too late?

**Features**  
- Unique 3D platforming through shadows.
- Animated shadow platforms and environments.
- Each level has its own scenery with small stories.
- A story of a person losing their shadow.
- A beautiful abstract world.

## Involvement
I came up with the idea of SCHiM during my final exam at Friesland College in 2020, and started development with Extra Nice. My work includes the creation of all the shaders, programming, 3D modelling and marketing.  
SCHiM is my first original indie title that I got to work on full-time, from start to finish. Together with Nils Slijkerman from Extra Nice, we were able to show our game at multiple events all over the world, and proudly put our name on the map as the *SCHiM developers*.
