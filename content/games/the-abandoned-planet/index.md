## Involvement
After just releasing our own title, Snapbreak reached out to me, curious about who created the console versions of SCHiM. After I told them I ported the game myself, they were interested in a collaboration for their own upcoming console releases.  
The moment I saw The Abandoned Planet, I knew this would be the perfect challenge to expand my console-porting portfolio, and to make the striking pixel art adventure accessible to play in the living room.

The Abandoned Planet releases on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4/5 and Xbox One/Series on 8 May 2025!

#### "*Working with Ewoud has made the difficult task of porting a game as easy at it can be (and it's not easy!).*"{{< line-break >}}- [Jeremy Fryc, Dexter Team Games](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremy-fryc-b2426b140/)
"*We met several times over video-chat and discussed certain changes that might be made to the game input so that it translated better to a gamepad. Even when some of these didn't pan out, Ewoud never complained. He was able to implement excellent gamepad support with no compromises. His extensive knowledge of Unity and developing his own games translates perfectly into his role of porting games. While I initially explained the architecture of game's code and folder structure, he didn't need his hand held; he was able to find solutions for complex issues that arose all on his own. He was very communicative throughout the process and gave me updates unprompted. It was an excellent experience!*"
