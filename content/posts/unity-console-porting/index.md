Are you developing a game in Unity? In this article you read what measures you can take in advance, so porting to console will be a cinch!  
This article is written to advice developers how they can best optimize their Unity game before the process of porting begins, it does not describe the installation, and use, of platform specific SDKs.
## Which Platforms Should We Launch On?
In this article, I want to focus on the three largest console platforms at this moment: Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4/5, and Xbox One/Series. Of course, I'll talk about how to prepare your game for porting to these platforms, but I also would like to shed some light on why you'd might want to prioritize one platform, or avoid the other.  
Does your game play great with a controller? For example if your game features many touchscreen based puzzles, it might be difficult to port your game to PlayStation or Xbox, without losing its essance.  
I recommend taking a look at what features each platform has, if it suits your game, and what similar games are doing. If possible, I highly recommend playing the games similar to yours on the different consoles, this way you can learn what it is you are looking for. And if you cannot find a competitor's game on a specific platform, maybe there is a good reason behind that.
