After 4+ years of programming, 3d modeling, concepting, polishing, marketing, porting, struggling, succeeding, traveling, and learning, we finally shipped SCHiM! ðŸš¢  
It's been pretty well documented that SCHiM started as my exam project, and I graduated pretty swiftly later. But only after I realized that my real test started!

## Multiplatform Release
One of the things I would have never believed to see is that we released SCHiM simultaneously on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1519710/SCHiM/), [Nintendo Switch](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/schim-switch/), [PlayStation 4/5](https://store.playstation.com/product/EP7967-PPSA13977_00-0189024348063801/) and [Xbox](https://xbox.com/games/store/schim/9nqgjpmt1p5j). I am also amazed that I was able to port SCHiM myself on all these platforms while still designing and developing the game.


It's an incredible feeling to play my own game on a Nintendo console, a brand that I grew up with myself ðŸ˜³
I hope to share this feeling with other indie game developers and help them port their games in the future.
