After 4+ years of programming, 3d modeling, concepting, polishing, marketing, porting, struggling, succeeding, traveling, and learning, we finally shipped SCHiM! ðŸš¢  
It's been pretty well documented that SCHiM started as my exam project, and I graduated pretty swiftly later. But only after I realized that my real test started!
