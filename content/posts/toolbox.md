My very first interaction with any creative software was with Windows Movie Maker when I was 9. Using my mom's camcorder I used to shoot my Lego minifigures picture by picture and watch the movements unfold in the primitive editing software.  
At that age, I always wanted to become an animator first. Just before entering high school I took an interest in computer-generated animation and found out about Blender. A program that would change my life, and introduce me to game development.

In this article I would like to simply list all the programs that I am using, I am always on the lookout to experiment with new software, especially open-source software!

## Game Development
- [Blender](https://blender.org/)
- [Unity](https://unity.com/)
- [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) (learning it right now, it's amazing! ðŸ˜„)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [FMOD](https://fmod.com/)
- [Plastic SCM](https://plasticscm.com/) (used for past projects, currently exploring other solutions)

## Production
- [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/designer/)
- [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/photo/)
- [Blender](https://blender.org/) (I also use Blender for simple video editing, it works great for what I need it for)
- [Honeycam](https://bandisoft.com/honeycam/) (IMO the best gif recorder at the moment, sadly not FOSS)
- [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/)
- [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)

## Productivity
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (currently my favorite note taking app, I use it both personally and professionally)
- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)
- [Discord](https://discord.com/) (while not ideal in a professional environment, a lot of important conversations are done through Discord)

## Other
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (at the time of writing this post, I am converting ewoud.dev to Hugo)
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) (used for schim.art, and when displaying 3D on the web)
